# Async Programming

## How to read/understand this repo?
- On *every branch* is a fully executable NodeJS program. You need to be able to execute `node` from a terminal to run them
- Read *commit messages* on any branch you are on. They contain additional directions to make the operations fail so you can see the "error" parts executed
- 3 *branches* (`master`, `promise_master`, `async-await_master`) contain 3 flavors of asynchronous programming. To appreciate how the programming approach changes across them, use `diff` or `pull request`
- Observe that the branch naming follows the convention `<branchDescription>_<sourceBranch>`
